== Upgrade notes

Read through these notes to learn more about upgrading to this release.

=== How to upgrade

Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from the Console. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-updating-ontap-cloud.html[Learn how to upgrade when the Console notifies you^].

=== Supported upgrade path
You can upgrade to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.16.1 from the 9.15.1 release in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The Console will prompt you to upgrade eligible Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to this release.


//Update this version for every major release. 9.x.0 v is can be usually upgraded from only the prev 9.x.1 version. But if the 9.x.0 version for a release has not gone, the n-2 for 9.x.1 will not be continued, and in that case only the previous 9.x.1 will be the upgrade path. Connector version removed as per code separation verification from engg: MM

=== Downtime

* The upgrade of a single node system takes the system offline for up to 25 minutes, during which I/O is interrupted.

* Upgrading an HA pair is non-disruptive and I/O is uninterrupted. During this non-disruptive upgrade process, each node is upgraded in tandem to continue serving I/O to clients.
